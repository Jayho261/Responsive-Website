# Jay's Portfolio Website
## Website address: jaythecoder.rf.gd
I created my personal portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript and JQuery. Created this project helped me go from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS to familiar with them now. This website was hosted by [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/)
